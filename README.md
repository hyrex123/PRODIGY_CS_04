 This Python script employs the pynput library to monitor keyboard input and record it into a file called "keyfile.txt". The code defines a function named keyPressed(key), which takes a key object as an argument, representing the pressed key. Within this function, the script prints out the string representation of the pressed key using str(key). It then attempts to extract the character representation of the key using key.char. If successful, it appends this character to the "keyfile.txt" file. In case there's an error in obtaining the character representation of the key, the script prints "Error getting char". The main section of the code, indicated by if __name__ == "__main__":, initializes a keyboard listener by creating a Listener object from the keyboard module. This listener is configured to call the keyPressed function whenever a key is pressed (on_press=keyPressed). The script then starts the listener with listener.start() and waits for user input using input(), effectively keeping the script running indefinitely to capture key presses. Overall, this script serves as a basic keylogger, continuously monitoring keyboard input and saving it to a file for later analysis.
